# Introduction

What we believe about other people matters. It is not enough that others are trustworthy, reasonable or well intentioned. Successful coordination, as well as individual wellbeing, benefit when we also *perceive* others as trustworthy, reasonable or well intentioned.

## Generalised trust

### Insight

### Influence / Gullibility

Altay, S., & Acerbi, A. (2023). People believe misinformation is a threat because they assume others are gullible. New Media & Society, 0(0). https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448231153379

Confidence in their abilities, friends’ and family’s abilities, and people’s abilities to spot misinformation was measured with three statements adapted from Corbu et al. (2020) and the European Commission (2018):
“I am able to identify news or information that misrepresent reality or is even false”
“My friends and family are able to identify news or information that misrepresent reality or is even false”
“People in general are able to identify news or information that misrepresent reality or is even false”

- negatively conceived
- unidimensional: influence

# Method

Part of a larger survey


## Sample

## Item development

correspondance (items 2 and 6)
coherance (items 7 and 8)
influence (items 3 and 5)
insight into behaviour (4)
naive endorsement (item 1)


See Table \@ref(tab:items)

```{r items, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
items <- c("The typical person is often irrational",
           "People are often misinformed on important issues",
           "People are too easily manipulated",
           "People often act for reasons they don’t understand or endorse",
           "The average person can be persuaded to change their mind if given good reasons",
           "Most people hold accurate views about the world",
           "For this question please click the middle option, ‘neutral’, to show you are paying attention",
           "An individual's beliefs about the world are generally coherent",
           "People's behaviour is generally consistent with their beliefs")

nums <- c("1","2","3","4","5","6","A","7","8")

df <- data.frame(nums,items)
#column.names(df) <- c("#","Item")

apa_table(
  df
  , caption = "Scale item wording"
  , note = "Response was on a 7 point Likert scale from (1 = \"Strong Disagree\", 7 = \"Strongly Agree\"). Items 1,2,3 and 4 reverse coded so that for all items higher scores represented stronger faith in reason."
  , escape = TRUE

Our data consist of `r nrow(df)` participants who completed our online survey. `r removed_by_attn_check` failed an attention check and were removed.

## TODO

Methods for assessing dimensionality
cronbach's alpha + leave on out
scree plots and EFA
Mokken scale analysis
EGA

Write up all of them?

Look at items and make sensible decisions. A single scale of 6 items and 2 subscales?


## Junyan

We asked 8 questions about rationality in the survey. To determine the homogeneity and the
fitness of the responses, I use Stata to perform Mokken scaling analysis. Testing all 8
rationality variables, the Mokken analysis yields one scale of 6 items. The items with low
Loevinger’s coefficient of homogeneity (H i ), a criterion for scalability, are dropped. If the
overall H&lt;0.3, it means the items in the scale are unrelated, thus cannot be accepted to form a
cumulative scale. As a rule of thumb, H i must be higher than 0.3 to be kept in the scale.
Therefore, there are 6 fitting items in the scale: rationality_1, rationality_2, rationality_3,
rationality_4, rationality_6, and rationality_7. The overall H coefficient is 0.41, indicating a
medium-strong scalability. The individual critical values in the scale are all lower than 80, so
the variables are double monotonous and there is no model violation.
Code: loevh rationality_1 rationality_2 rationality_3 rationality_4 rationality_6 rationality_7,
pair monotonicity(*) ppp pmm nipmatrix(minvi(0.03) siglevel(0.01))
We can thus generate a rationality variable by aggregating those six variables. Cronbach’s $\alpha$
is 0.78, indicating an acceptable internal consistency.

Based on the statistical results, it looks to me that rationality_5 (The average person can be
persuaded to change if given good reasons) is a real problem, it doesn’t fit at all with other items

3
and must be removed. Rationality_8 (People&#39;s behaviour is generally consistent with their beliefs)
has a poor fitness, but it is not as bad as rationality_5.

Next, I try to scale the remaining two items that are not included in the above scale –
rationality_5 and rationality_8. As expected, these two items doesn’t form a separate scale.
Empirically, these items are excluded from the rationality measure by Mokken scaling likely
because persuasion effect is not a robust indication of rationality?

## Tom

Obviously 5 is weakly correlated. Omitting gives biggest boost to Cronbach's alpha, EEGnet suggests weakly related to all other items, 

EEGnet suggets two commuities
Scree plot of factors suggests border of unidimension and bidimensional
mokken analysis suggests 1 domension, BUT if you remove items 5 and 9 you then find 2 dim3nsions at 0.35

# Discussion

## Normative models

arguably our scale doesn't touch on normative models of rationality as captured by T&K. Bias, prejudice
