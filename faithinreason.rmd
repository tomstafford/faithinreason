# Introduction

What we believe about other people matters. It is not enough that others *are* trustworthy, reasonable or well intentioned. Successful coordination, as well as individual wellbeing, benefit when we also *perceive* others as trustworthy, reasonable or well intentioned.


## Rationality

The nature of human reason is a perennial topic. Human rationality has been praised ("a thinking reed") and condemned ("TK") by different thinkers. The so-called 'Rationality Wars' (TK) centered around the definition of rationality that might reasonably used as a standard against which to judge human reasoning

An influential research programme is the heuristics and biases programme in psychology (TK), which uses the ideal of economic rationality as a standard to define actual human reasoning against. From this perspective human reasoning appears riddled with biases, but much work is done by the adoption of the standards of utility theory, formal logic and precise statistical reasoning. 

Mercier and Sperber's argumentative theory of reasons provides an account TK
TK cite my Frontiers paper, BBC commentary

## Criteria of reason

So rationality is not a unitary concept, nor one around which there is consensus on the definition of, despite the way it is often evoked in discussion (and particularly in discussion of its negation e.g.  "they are being irrational").

That said, core features of rationality have been proposed.

Dawson, N. V., & Gregory, F. (2009). Correspondence and coherence in science: A brief historical perspective. Judgment and decision making, 4(2), 126-133.

### Insight 

Nisbett, R. E., & Wilson, T. D. (1977). Telling more than we can know: Verbal reports on mental processes. Psychological review, 84(3), 231.



### Influence / Gullibility

Altay, S., & Acerbi, A. (2023). People believe misinformation is a threat because they assume others are gullible. New Media & Society, 0(0). https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448231153379

Confidence in their abilities, friends’ and family’s abilities, and people’s abilities to spot misinformation was measured with three statements adapted from Corbu et al. (2020) and the European Commission (2018):
“I am able to identify news or information that misrepresent reality or is even false”
“My friends and family are able to identify news or information that misrepresent reality or is even false”
“People in general are able to identify news or information that misrepresent reality or is even false”

- negatively conceived
- unidimensional: influence


Summary: so core features of rationality include coherance, correspondence, surceptibility to influence and insight into causes of ones actions. The extent to which these features form a coherent whole in the minds of the general public, and can meaningfully be asked about questions about is the primary topic of this paper.

## Consequence of a lack of faith in reason

### Second order effexcts of Disinfo

The generalised belief that others are well informed and reasonable is foundational to democracy. Recent concerns around misinformation may have second order effects, undermining democracy not by generating a misinformed populace, but by generating a populace that believes others are misunformed or unreasonable [@karpf2019]. Alarmism around misinformation may potentially lower trust in institutions [@hoes2022], increase skepticism about democracy [@jungherr2022; @nisbet2021], or foster calls of tighter media regulation [@lee2021].


### Third person effect

There is an established literature of the perception of media influence on others [@perloff2002; @sun2008]. The `third person effect', proposed by @davison1983, is the phenomenon whereby many people believe others are more susceptible to influence than themselves. The third person effect was proposed as a root cause of censorship instincts and this has been confirmed by subsequent empricial investigations [@olshansky2020; @feng2012].

Two caveats around the third person effect. Lyons [-@lyons2022] has recently argued that - for many people - a third person effect of greater media influence on others rather than the self will be an accurate perception. @chung2016 have argued that the driving factor in many so-called third person effects is the perception of others (as highly influenced), rather than the discrepancy with first person perception per se.

TK we directly measured the TPE!!

## Reproducibility

Data availability: The analysis code and anonymised response data which support the results here are openly available https://github.com/tomstafford/faithinreason 

This repository contains the files used to generate this report, which is in the form of a `reproducible manuscript`, a document which generates the analysis it reports, and so combines sharing, documenting and reporting an analysis in a single set of project files.

Ritems <- dplyr::select(df,c(Q19_1:Q19_4,Q19_6,Q19_8))

Ritems <- Ritems %>% rowwise() %>% mutate(mean = mean(c_across(everything())))
#make histogram

p <- ggplot(data = Ritems,mapping= aes(mean))
#p + geom_bar(fill="red") + scale_x_binned()

    labels = c("1 Strongly disagree","2","3","4 neutral","5","6","7 Strongly agree")) +
    labs(x = "Faith in reason")
```

The average score across these six  items was `r round(mean(Ritems$mean),2)`, a summary statistic which suggests that the typical view of other people weighted to being slightly less, rather than slightly more, reasonable. The distribution is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:meanhistogram).

```{r education, fig.cap="Education level and mean FIR", fig.align="center", out.width="75%",fig.height=4}

# calculate mean of y for each value of x
mean_df <- df %>% group_by(Q11) %>% summarize(mean_fir = mean(mean))

# create bar chart

p +

  geom_smooth(method=lm) +
  labs(x = "Faith in reason",
       y = "Importance of democracy")

```

```

Correlation between Q17 and FIR

```{r correlations}

cor_items <- df %>% dplyr::select(mean,Q16,Q17)

# calculate correlation matrix
cor_matrix <- round(cor(cor_items),2)

```
## TODO

Methods for assessing dimensionality
cronbach's alpha + leave on out
scree plots and EFA
Mokken scale analysis
EGA

Write up all of them?

Look at items and make sensible decisions. A single scale of 6 items and 2 subscales?


## Junyan

We asked 8 questions about rationality in the survey. To determine the homogeneity and the
fitness of the responses, I use Stata to perform Mokken scaling analysis. Testing all 8
rationality variables, the Mokken analysis yields one scale of 6 items. The items with low
Loevinger’s coefficient of homogeneity (H i ), a criterion for scalability, are dropped. If the
overall H&lt;0.3, it means the items in the scale are unrelated, thus cannot be accepted to form a
cumulative scale. As a rule of thumb, H i must be higher than 0.3 to be kept in the scale.
Therefore, there are 6 fitting items in the scale: rationality_1, rationality_2, rationality_3,
rationality_4, rationality_6, and rationality_7. The overall H coefficient is 0.41, indicating a
medium-strong scalability. The individual critical values in the scale are all lower than 80, so
the variables are double monotonous and there is no model violation.
Code: loevh rationality_1 rationality_2 rationality_3 rationality_4 rationality_6 rationality_7,
pair monotonicity(*) ppp pmm nipmatrix(minvi(0.03) siglevel(0.01))
We can thus generate a rationality variable by aggregating those six variables. Cronbach’s $\alpha$
is 0.78, indicating an acceptable internal consistency.

Based on the statistical results, it looks to me that rationality_5 (The average person can be
persuaded to change if given good reasons) is a real problem, it doesn’t fit at all with other items

3
and must be removed. Rationality_8 (People&#39;s behaviour is generally consistent with their beliefs)
has a poor fitness, but it is not as bad as rationality_5.

Next, I try to scale the remaining two items that are not included in the above scale –
rationality_5 and rationality_8. As expected, these two items doesn’t form a separate scale.
Empirically, these items are excluded from the rationality measure by Mokken scaling likely
because persuasion effect is not a robust indication of rationality?

## Tom

Obviously 5 is weakly correlated. Omitting gives biggest boost to Cronbach's alpha, EEGnet suggests weakly related to all other items, 

EEGnet suggets two commuities
Scree plot of factors suggests border of unidimension and bidimensional
mokken analysis suggests 1 domension, BUT if you remove items 5 and 9 you then find 2 dim3nsions at 0.35

# Discussion

## Normative models

arguably our scale doesn't touch on normative models of rationality as captured by T&K. Bias, prejudice
