# Introduction

What we believe about other people matters. It is not enough that others are trustworthy, reasonable or well intentioned. Successful coordination, as well as individual wellbeing, benefit when we also *perceive* others as trustworthy, reasonable or well intentioned.

## Generalised trust

## Third person effect


- Some part of the TPE may be driven by accurate perception of others

## Gullibility

Altay, S., & Acerbi, A. (2023). People believe misinformation is a threat because they assume others are gullible. New Media & Society, 0(0). https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448231153379

Confidence in their abilities, friends’ and family’s abilities, and people’s abilities to spot misinformation was measured with three statements (αUK = .54, αUS = .53) adapted from Corbu et al. (2020) and the European Commission (2018):
“I am able to identify news or information that misrepresent reality or is even false”
“My friends and family are able to identify news or information that misrepresent reality or is even false”
“People in general are able to identify news or information that misrepresent reality or is even false”

- negatively conceived
- unidimensional: influence

# Method

Part of a larger survey


## Sample

## Item development

See Table \@ref(tab:items)

```{r items, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
items <- c("The typical person is often irrational",
           "People are often misinformed on important issues",
           "People are too easily manipulated",
           "People often act for reasons they don’t understand or endorse",
           "The average person can be persuaded to change their mind if given good reasons",
           "Most people hold accurate views about the world",
           "For this question please click the middle option, ‘neutral’, to show you are paying attention",
           "An individual's beliefs about the world are generally coherent",
           "People's behaviour is generally consistent with their beliefs")

nums <- c("1","2","3","4","5","6","A","7","8")

df <- data.frame(nums,items)
#column.names(df) <- c("a","Item")

apa_table(
  df
  , caption = "Scale item wording"
  , note = "Response was on a 7 point Likert scale from (1 = \"Strong Disagree\", 7 = \"Strongly Agree\"). Items 1,2,3 and 4 reverse coded so that for all items higher scores represented stronger faith in reason."
  , escape = TRUE
  , span_text_columns = FALSE
)

```


## Prereg


# Results

Now let's integrate some R code to generate/import some data, run and analyse and integrate it into the document:

```{r results='hide'}
#copying from https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/r-code.html
#this is some R code which evaluates when you make the document
#

#----------------Code for generating some random data

#parameters of our variables
meanA <- 100
sdA <- 15
d <- .5
sdB <- sdA
pooledSD <- sdA
meanB <- meanA + (d * pooledSD)
n1 <- 300
n2 <- 300

#create random data, put into dataframe
groupA <- rnorm(n1, meanA, sdA)
groupB <- rnorm(n2, meanB, sdB)
sub <- 1:length(n1+n2)
group <- c(rep(0,n1) ,rep(1,n2))
values <- c(groupA, groupB)
df <- data.frame(sub, group, values)

#add some missing values
index <- sample(1:(n1+n2),5)
df[index, 3] <- NA

#export to a file
write.csv(df, file = "generateddata.csv")
```

You can't see it in the PDF, but in between this paragraph and the last we asked R to generate some random data and save it to a CSV file. Now we're going to import the data from the CSV file, as if it was independently created data - from an experiment or similar - and plot a graph.

```{r ourhistogram, fig.cap="Histogram of all data, grouped", fig.align="center", out.width="75%",fig.height=4}
#load data
df=read.csv("generateddata.csv")


#make histogram
#cribbing from https://www.statmethods.net/graphs/density.html
x <- df$values
x <- na.omit(x) #drop missing values
h<-hist(x, breaks=20, col="red", xlab="value")
xfit<-seq(min(x),max(x),length=40)
yfit<-dnorm(xfit,mean=mean(x),sd=sd(x))
yfit <- yfit*diff(h$mids[1:2])*length(x)
lines(xfit, yfit, col="blue", lwd=2) 
```

See Figure \@ref(fig:ourhistogram). Of course we could draw all sorts of things, but this is a proof-of-concept. Finally, let's run a t-test and integrate the results into the text.

```{r}
#note that seperate code chunks remember variables from previous chunks, so we don't need to reload the data
df$group <- as.factor(df$group)
model1<-t.test(df$values ~ df$group)

p<- model1$p.value
t<- model1$statistic
df<- model1$parameter
if(p<0.05){
  word<-"a"
} else {
  word<-"no"
}
    
```

We found there was `r word` statistically significant difference between the two groups (t=`r t` (`r df`), p = `r p`). Note how the exact values in the previous sentence change every time we re-make the document (because the document also re-generates the underlying data).

The above paragraph does the integration of statistics longform, because I didn't know a better way (and because I think it is still useful to show). apa_print() exists as a helper function: [http://frederikaust.com/papaja_man/reporting.html](http://frederikaust.com/papaja_man/reporting.html).

```{r asrssub, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
Hyperactivity <- c("5,6,12,13,14", "5,6")
Inattention <- c("1,2,3,4,7,8", "1,2,3,4")

df <- data.frame(Hyperactivity, Inattention)
row.names(df) <- c("ASRS-18","ASRS-6")

apa_table(
  df
  , caption = "Item grouping to subscales"
  , note = "This table was created with apa_table()."
  , escape = TRUE
  , span_text_columns = FALSE
)
```

Also, everyone loves tables. See Table \@ref(tab:asrssub). I feel obliged to mention that the actual items reported in this table **do not** correctly reflect the actual subscales for the ASRS short and long scales. Note illustration of **bold** and *italics* formatting in this para.
