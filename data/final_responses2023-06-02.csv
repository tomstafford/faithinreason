Before you decide whether or not to take part it is important that you understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take the time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish. Please email us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. You are also welcome at any time to contact the project supervisor, Professor Tom Stafford (contact details below).



What is the purpose of the study? 



This study is interested in understanding how people living in the UK make judgments about political campaign material such as the political advertisements they may come across in person or online.



Why have I been chosen?



You have been chosen because this research is interested in the opinions of those who are living in the UK.



Do I have to take part?



Participation is entirely voluntary. If you choose to take part, you can change your mind at any time and withdraw from the study without giving a reason by simply closing the web browser (to do this, click the cross on the internet tab you are using to complete the survey). However, please note that any questions that you have already completed will be saved in our data set, and as the study is completed anonymously, we will not be able to identify your data in order to remove it.



What will happen to me if I take part?



It is expected this study will take you between 6-10 minutes to complete, and it is necessary to complete the survey in one go. If you are happy to take part, you will be asked to consent to the study. You will first be taken to a series of questions that ask you what you think about politics in the UK. Then, you will view election campaign advertisements published online by a political party. You will be asked a series of questions about what you think of the advertisements, the political party, and the types of online platforms that publish political advertisements. Lastly, you will be asked some general questions about yourself, such as how you identify politically (for example if you consider yourself left-wing or right-wing) as well as your age, gender and level of education. After completing the study, you will be given information to read through that provides further details about what you’ve seen. Please note there will be attention checks throughout the survey to ensure high quality responses.



What are the possible risks or disadvantages of taking part?



If you choose to complete the survey, you will be asked about your political opinions, social media usage and shown political campaign advertisements. Everything you are shown will be similar to the types of advertisements you will typically see in person or online and they are not expected to cause any discomfort. However, it is recognised that the nature of the topic can be uncomfortable to think about. If you choose to participate and experience any discomfort, you are reminded you can leave the study at any point by closing the browser window. You are also reminded that the purpose of the study is not to influence your opinions, but to understand how you make judgments. The political information shown to you does not reflect the views of the research team or the University of Sheffield more widely. Additionally, there will be no way for the researchers to identify your individual response and all measures will be taken to ensure anonymity, meaning there is no risk to your privacy after completing the study.



What are the possible benefits of taking part?



If you choose to complete the full survey and answer the attention check questions correctly, then you will be paid for your time. Please note if you exit the study early or fail all attention checks you will not receive this payment. Another possible benefit is you will be contributing to scientific understanding of how judgments are made in various social situations, which is valuable information that can be used by other scientists and the general public more widely.



What if something goes wrong?



If you accidentally consent to the study without meaning to, you can exit the survey at any point by closing the browser window. If you accidentally choose the wrong response, we encourage you to not worry and carry on with the remainder of the survey as normal. If you experience any problems with the survey or are not happy with something you see, please feel free to contact the research team using the information provided.



What is the legal basis for processing my personal data?



We are required to inform you that the legal basis we are applying in order to process your personal data is that ‘processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest’ (Article 6(1)(e)). Moreover, as you may choose to disclose your political opinions, such data processing is necessary for ‘scientific research purposes' (9(2)(j))’. Further information can be found in the University’s Privacy Notice https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/govern/data-protection/privacy/general.



Will my taking part in this study be kept confidential?



Yes. You will not be asked to provide any identifying information other than your Prolific Academic ID. Your individual data will be merged with the data from the other participants and stored in a dataset. In any publications, we will only discuss overall trends in the data, rather than discussing information about any individual participant. We will collect no identifiable information so responses will be entirely anonymous. The data will be stored in an online repository called the Open Science Framework and made open for other researchers to view and analyse if they choose. As the responses are anonymised, this does not pose any risk to your privacy. The reason for sharing the data openly is to allow other scientists to check our conclusions, which promotes good scientific practice.



What will happen to the results of the research?



We intend to publish the results in a peer-reviewed academic journal in the field of psychology. If you are interested in a summary of the results once data collection and analysis has been completed, please use the contact information to let the researchers know and they can ensure you are kept up to date with the progress of the study.



Who is the Data Controller?



The University of Sheffield will act as the Data Controller for this study. This means that the University is responsible for looking after your information and using it properly.



Who has reviewed the study?



This project has received ethics approval by the Department of Psychology Ethics Committee. The University’s Research Ethics Committee monitors the application and delivery of the University’s Ethics Review Procedure across the University.

Thank you for taking part in our research, your response is greatly appreciated. Please take some time to read the following important information.



We would first like to make it clear that The Reconnect Party and their campaign advertisements were fictional and created by the researchers for the purpose of this experiment. The information you may have viewed along with the advertisements, such as who sponsored the advertisement and if it was targeted, were also fictional.



We would like to tell you a bit more about the aims of the study. This survey was an experiment and some participants were shown slightly different materials to what you saw. The purpose of the study was to test whether viewing a ‘digital imprint’ with a political advertisement influenced the judgments made about them. A digital imprint is a disclaimer included somewhere in close proximity to paid political adverts to disclose extra information it, such as who paid for its promotion. This is now legally required by the UK government on paid political advertisements, online and in person.



Each person who took part in this survey was randomly assigned into one of three groups. The first group saw the adverts with no imprint, the second with an imprint disclosing who paid for the advert to be promoted, and the third group saw extra information such as if it had been targeted towards certain groups. Of specific interest to this research was whether including a digital imprint in the advertisements had an influence on trust.



The reason we chose to create fictional advertisements is because it’s likely that many taking part in the survey would have ideas about and affiliations with existing UK political parties. It was important to the aims of the study that those taking part had not already decided what they thought about the campaign material they were shown. The content of the advertisements were designed to be quite general, to avoid The Reconnect Party having any strong associations with existing party campaigns.



It is important for you to know the political views seen in the advertisements do not represent the views of the researchers or the University of Sheffield more widely. It is also important to make you aware that the political views promoted were designed to look persuasive, but are not a part of any wider political campaign. The advertisements may have expressed views you agree or disagree with, but it was not intended that the content of the advertisements influence your political beliefs.



We encourage you to do your own research when deciding which political party to support. In the case you’d like to know more about the options available to you when voting in general elections, we have provided a website link below about the political parties whose representatives were successful in elections to the House of Commons at the 2019 General Election. You can right click the link to open it in a new internet tab and return to the tab after submitting your survey response. Please note which parties are available for you to vote for can depend on which country and constituency you live in. In your constituency, there may also be other political parties available for you to vote for outside of those listed. You can find out more information from your local council website about this on the lead up to election time.



More information can be found at the following link: https://members.parliament.uk/parties/Commons



The research team did not intend to show you content any more distressing than what you might see when browsing online, however we recognise viewing the material may have caused discomfort. If you would like, you can use the box below to express any concerns about what you saw or share your experience of the survey more generally. Keep in mind these responses will be anonymous.
