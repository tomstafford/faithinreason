We are looking for general adult internet users based in the UK to answer a survey. In the survey, we ask questions about your demographics, online experience, beliefs in democracy and perceptions of political advertising. The survey should take no more than 30 minutes to complete.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><br>\n<strong>Voluntary Participation<\/strong><br>\nIt is your decision to take part or not.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">By clicking the option below, you indicate that you give consent.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">You can withdraw at any time by simply closing your browser.

We will therefore have no control over how these data are used.
