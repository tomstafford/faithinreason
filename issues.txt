Change title? BIRO?


# Results /  Additional Analysis

full items or just subscales? Explicitly present reduced set scale as sensitivity analaysis

discuss role of 4 aspects of reason in final scale (coherance etc)

age and gender effects (cohorts)

left / right wing view and scores?

electorial participation

is FiR still below average for positively framed items?



## CogSci R1

3. The weakest part of the paper, unfortunately, is the presentation of the main
    analysis. The scatterplots provide duplicate information as the correlation
    matrix, so I'd drop them. The matrix is incomplete - there are no p-values, no
    confidence intervals, no indication that multiple comparisons were used due to
    this all being exploratory work. Moreover, some of the variables on there are
    clearly single items, and thus not continuous variables in the normal sense.
    Kendall's tau should be computed instead of Pearson's r. The regression isn't
    presented clearly, and almost no relevant information from it is given to the
    reader. The R^2 value is nice, but where are the F(dfs) & p values for the
    regression as a whole? What about any of the actual coefficients, standard errors,
    t/z scores, and associated significanct tests? This is the minimal information
    needed and it's all missing. Moreover, the text suggests, though not clearly, that
    some variables included were not predictively relevant. Why keep them in? Why not
    compute a reduced model, test it against the full model, and report the comparison
    values (likelihood ratio, AIC, &/or BIC, or even Bayes Factors) and the results of
    the winner?


# Discussion

Relation between negative / positive items and subscales

framing of hypoesis
- doesn't affect NFD, TPE, election participation

Relation with beliefs about cooperaiton -  CogSci R1:

However, there are some issues with the work as it is currently presented. With
    regard to (3) theoretical merit, the authors fail to clarify the distinction
    between epistemic rationality (which their work focuses on exclusively) and
    instrumental rationality (the importance of which is discussed broadly by, e.g.,
    Baron, 2008, Ch.3; Evans, 2012, Chater & Oaksford, 1999). In the motivation of
    their paper, the authors should, I think, directly engage with how they think this
    scale measures something different than a general willingess to cooperate with,
    and expect cooperation from, others. Obviously the questions are not worded like
    this, but the scale isn't a measure of an enduring trait (and the authors do not
    claim it is), but rather of a current (cluster of) attitude(s) about 'other
    people'. In this sense, what subjects are expressing when they answer may be
    psychologically quite different, and I think the authors need to motivate why
    trying to tap into beliefs/attitudes about the reasonableness of others is an
    importantly different thing than beliefs/attitudes about cooperativity. A minor
    point here is that the scale should more correctly be referred to as something
    like 'Belief in Reasonableness of Others' scale, since it is not about people's
    beliefs about reason itself.


# Additional data collection

test-retest

randomise order

improve items (remove double barell etc)
R4: People often act for reasons they don’t understand or endorse

R5 (The average person can
    be persuaded to change their mind if given good reasons) maybe change to
    “convincing” rather than “good”? Saying “good” might promote moralistic ways of
    thinking, potentially adding an unnecessary layer of complication

Balance items by aspect


# Theoretical developent

- is stable?

- is manipulatable?

- relation to geeneralised trust or cooperation?

- upstream of attitudes to democracy (polic??)

instrumental variable study?
- test -retest + election result (right wing left wing and predictions)
