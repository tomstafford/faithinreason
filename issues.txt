# Write up

Change title? BIRO?

Options
- submit as is, somewhere minor
- working paper, focussing on scale development
- experimental study using election

Conclusions
- wide variability, but not strongly predictive of anything (except trust?)


# Results /  Additional Analysis

OPTIONAL full items or just subscales? Explicitly present reduced set scale as sensitivity analaysis

OPTIONAL discuss role of 4 aspects of reason in final scale (coherance etc)

DO age and gender effects (cohorts)

DO left / right wing view and scores?

RE-DO electorial participation

DO is FiR still below average for positively framed items?



## CogSci R1

3. The weakest part of the paper, unfortunately, is the presentation of the main
    analysis. The scatterplots provide duplicate information as the correlation
    matrix, so I'd drop them. The matrix is incomplete - there are no p-values, no
    confidence intervals, no indication that multiple comparisons were used due to
    this all being exploratory work. Moreover, some of the variables on there are
    clearly single items, and thus not continuous variables in the normal sense.
    Kendall's tau should be computed instead of Pearson's r. The regression isn't
    presented clearly, and almost no relevant information from it is given to the
    reader. The R^2 value is nice, but where are the F(dfs) & p values for the
    regression as a whole? What about any of the actual coefficients, standard errors,
    t/z scores, and associated significanct tests? This is the minimal information
    needed and it's all missing. Moreover, the text suggests, though not clearly, that
    some variables included were not predictively relevant. Why keep them in? Why not
    compute a reduced model, test it against the full model, and report the comparison
    values (likelihood ratio, AIC, &/or BIC, or even Bayes Factors) and the results of
    the winner?


# Discussion

 
Relation between negative / positive items and subscales

framing of hypoesis
- doesn't affect NFD, TPE, election participation,
- weak relations to age, gender, right wing nesss

Relation with beliefs about cooperaiton -  CogSci R1:

However, there are some issues with the work as it is currently presented. With
    regard to (3) theoretical merit, the authors fail to clarify the distinction
    between epistemic rationality (which their work focuses on exclusively) and
    instrumental rationality (the importance of which is discussed broadly by, e.g.,
    Baron, 2008, Ch.3; Evans, 2012, Chater & Oaksford, 1999). In the motivation of
    their paper, the authors should, I think, directly engage with how they think this
    scale measures something different than a general willingess to cooperate with,
    and expect cooperation from, others. Obviously the questions are not worded like
    this, but the scale isn't a measure of an enduring trait (and the authors do not
    claim it is), but rather of a current (cluster of) attitude(s) about 'other
    people'. In this sense, what subjects are expressing when they answer may be
    psychologically quite different, and I think the authors need to motivate why
    trying to tap into beliefs/attitudes about the reasonableness of others is an
    importantly different thing than beliefs/attitudes about cooperativity. A minor
    point here is that the scale should more correctly be referred to as something
    like 'Belief in Reasonableness of Others' scale, since it is not about people's
    beliefs about reason itself.


# Election participation data collection

From Wave 23 of the British Election Survey

//
During the last 12 months, have you done any of the following? -

Done any work on behalf of a political party or political action group.
Given any money to a political party, organisation or cause.
Displayed an election poster.
Listened to or watched a party election broadcast.
Read a campaign leaflet/letter, text message or email from a political party.
Tried to persuade somebody which party they should vote for.

I've put it in this folder. This dataset still includes responses that need to be excluded for completing in half median time (270 seconds):

%>% filter(Duration..in.seconds.<270)

Faith in reason items (FIR): columns 71 - 78
Election participation items (ELECT_PAR): columns 85 - 90



May 2023

~1200 UK voters). I'm also going to include the political participation items from the British Electoral Survey (things like "I voted in the last five years"). What bets will you give me on the correlation??

Election participation items are



Almost nobody had done any of the first three

Arguably there are better measures of investment in democrat activity, but for now I think we can mark this preregistered bet as lost



# Additional data collection

## Scale development

test-retest

randomise order

improve items (remove double barell etc)
R4: People often act for reasons they don’t understand or endorse

R5 (The average person can
    be persuaded to change their mind if given good reasons) maybe change to
    “convincing” rather than “good”? Saying “good” might promote moralistic ways of
    thinking, potentially adding an unnecessary layer of complication

Balance items by aspect

## External validity

Tom: do you use tripadvisor, trust amazon reviews
Sacha: You could almost do these behavioral tasks of social information use to see if faith in reason is associated with e.g. less advice use when it’s the average of all other participants (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513819300030). 

# Theoretical developent

- is stable?

- is manipulatable?

- relation to geeneralised trust or cooperation?

- upstream of attitudes to democracy (polic??)

Sacha "Overall it may be worth focusing on participative democracy in particular rather than democracy in general—which may just be understood as not having a dictator and being able to vote from time to time. And I think we have reason to think that more participative democracy would be better to make the best of collective intelligence, etc.""
"

instrumental variable study?
- test -retest + election result (right wing left wing and predictions)
